            <p>The University of Wolverhampton offers various forms of financial aid to help students manage the costs of their education. These include:</p>

            <h3>1. Scholarships</h3>
            <p>Scholarships are awards based on academic merit, financial need, or specific criteria related to your course of study.

            <h3>2. Grants</h3>
            <p>Grants are financial awards given to students based on specific eligibility criteria, such as financial need. Unlike loans, grants do not need to be repaid, making them an excellent option for students in need of financial assistance.</p>

            <p>Student loans are offered by the government and private lenders to help students pay for their tuition, fees, and living expenses. These loans usually come with lower interest rates than standard loans and offer flexible repayment options after graduation. Be sure to explore the terms and conditions of student loans to understand how they will affect you in the long term.</p>

            <h3>4. Work-Study Programs</h3>
            <p>Work-study programs offer students the opportunity to work part-time while studying to help cover their living expenses. These jobs are typically on-campus and are designed to be flexible around your academic schedule.</p>

            <h2>Budgeting Tips for University Students</h2>
            <p>Once you receive your financial aid, it's important to create a budget to manage your funds effectively. Here are some tips to help you get started:</p>
            <h3>1. Track Your Income and Expenses</h3>
            <p>Keep a detailed record of all income (including scholarships, grants, and work-study earnings) and expenses (tuition, rent, food, transport, etc.). This will help you understand your spending habits and where you can save money.</p>

            <h3>2. Set Financial Goals</h3>
            <p>Establish clear financial goals for the academic year, such as saving a specific amount or reducing unnecessary spending. Having goals in place will keep you motivated to stick to your budget.</p>

            <h3>3. Save for Emergencies</h3>
            <p>It's always a good idea to have an emergency fund to cover unexpected expenses. Try to set aside a small portion of your financial aid for emergencies or unexpected costs.</p>

            <h3>4. Look for Student Discounts</h3>
            <p>As a student, you are eligible for numerous discounts on everything from travel to clothing. Be sure to take advantage of these discounts to save money throughout the year.</p>

            <h3>5. Avoid Unnecessary Debt</h3>
            <p>Try to avoid using credit cards to fund non-essential purchases. It's easy to accumulate debt quickly, which can be difficult to pay off later. Only take out loans for essential educational expenses, and avoid taking on more than you can afford to repay.</p>

    <!-- Loan Repayment Tips Section -->
    <section id="loan-repayment-tips">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>Loan Repayment Tips</h2>
            <p>Student loans are a common form of financial aid, but they do need to be repaid after you graduate. Here are some tips to help you manage your loan repayment effectively:</p>
            <h3>1. Understand the Terms of Your Loan</h3>
            <p>Before taking out a loan, be sure to understand the interest rates, repayment schedule, and any other terms attached to it. Knowing these details will help you plan for repayment once you finish your studies.</p>

            <h3>2. Set Up a Repayment Plan</h3>
            <p>Work with your lender to set up a manageable repayment plan that works with your post-graduation income. Many lenders offer income-driven repayment options based on how much you earn after graduation.</p>

            <h3>3. Pay Off Higher Interest Loans First</h3>
            <p>If you have multiple loans, prioritize paying off the ones with the highest interest rates first. This will help you save money on interest over time.</p>

            <h3>4. Explore Loan Forgiveness Programs</h3>
            <p>Some loan forgiveness programs are available for students who go into certain professions, such as teaching or public service. Research whether you qualify for any loan forgiveness options.</p>

            <h3>5. Keep Track of Your Loan Balance</h3>
            <p>Stay on top of your loan balance and ensure you don’t miss any payments. Defaulting on a student loan can severely damage your credit score and make it difficult to secure future loans.</p>
